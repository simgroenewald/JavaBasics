Level 2 Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 2

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called rockPaperScissors.java
● Write a program that allows the user to play the rock, paper, scissors
game.
● The program should randomly generate a number 0, 1, 2, which

○ Paper beats rock

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called averageNumber.java
● Write a program that determines how many positive and negative
integers have been entered and calculates the total and average of all the
entered numbers.
● Firstly ask the user to enter any number of integers. The user should enter
0 to indicate the end of their input.
● The program should then determine the number of positive and negative
integers entered by the user, and print out the result.
● The total of all integers entered as well as the average should then be
calculated and displayed.

Compulsory Task 3
Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called factorial.java
● Write a program that determines the factorial of a number entered by a
user.
● Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
● Then calculate the factorial of the given number. For any positive integer
n, it’s factorial is given by:
○ factorial = 1*2*3…*n
● Finally, print out the factorial.
